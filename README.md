A tool to auto adjust brightness based on user defined programs.

It was developed because The Last Of Us II was too dark at normal brightness,
and switching to normal environments on high brightness like a browser hurt the eyes.

1. Register Syncfusion license (free community or paid) in AutoBrightness/App.cs
2. place the release ---> AutoBrightness/bin/Release on Desktop and run the program
